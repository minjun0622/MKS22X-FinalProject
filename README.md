Worked on the prototype today due to the fact that it was not complete. Plan to complete the prototype by tomorrow by 8:40.
Read over guidelines and tweaked the class structure. The stages and the developmental phase could not be completed because my partner was absent.

Wrote the snake methods and filled some in. Will work on more. Divide the work. My partner is doing Maze class. Also, edited more code in the experimentation folder of Processing under the repo. For the experimentation I figured out how to use keyCode(make keys get recognized in processing).

Researched more functions involving keyPressed. In the experimentation folder, you can press keys to create rectangles to create assignment to integer direction.
In the project folder, I used the same idea to plan out more about how the snake is going to move. I have decided also to create 2 ArrayLists of moves to help facilitate the process because ArrayLists were easier to add to. However, I need to work out the math involved in movement.

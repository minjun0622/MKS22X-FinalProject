Worked on the prototype today due to the fact that it was not complete. Plan to complete the prototype by tomorrow by 8:40.
Read over guidelines and tweaked the class structure. The stages and the developmental phase could not be completed because my partner was absent.

Wrote the snake methods and filled some in. Will work on more. Divide the work. My partner is doing Maze class. Also, edited more code in the experimentation folder of Processing under the repo. For the experimentation I figured out how to use keyCode(make keys get recognized in processing).

This README.md update got erased I think due to merge conflicts, therefore, I am not sure what I did. However, i think that this was the same except I worked further on the experimentation folder. I made rectangles using the keys and made them disappear. Will apply same principles inside the final project.

Separated the tabs for different classes in the final project. This meant that the directory had to be remade. Also, I further worked on the locomotion of the snake and how it moves. I am using a ArrayList of floats instead of an array because it's easier to add and get.

Started working on the maze class. Thinking of how to display the maze and it's walls. Used a 2d boolean to represent where the walls will be.

The walls make the borders properly and is divided up properly. Background and colors for walls are temporarily decided and set. The maze is made completely randomly right now, not exactly an efficient maze structure.
